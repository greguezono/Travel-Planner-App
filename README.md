# Travel Planner Web Application
Final Project (Project 5) for Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program. For this project I created a travel planner application, 
which takes in as input a *location*, a *departure date*, and a *return date*. The planner then logs the destination name, departing date, and weather information as an entry
in the planner.

*Note that the due to the limitations of the WeatherBit API, the departure date can only be within 16 days of the current date.*

### Instructions
1. Clone the github repo.
2. In the command line, go to the Project directory:
  - Run `npm install` 
  - Run `npm run build`
  - Run `npm start`
3. The app should now be running on the port specified (default is http://localhost:8081). Open the port in a web browser and the app should be up and running!
